# bumble:live host runbook

You are the production host. Your laptop owns the YouTube stream. Nico, Sebi, and Chris are remote contributors over VDO.Ninja. This runbook is tailored to Linux, 1080p30, x264 software encoding (the host box is Intel-only).

## 0. What you need

Host machine: modern Linux laptop or desktop, wired Ethernet if available, 1080p webcam, headset or good microphone. A second monitor helps a lot.

Everyone: Chrome or Firefox, headphones or headset (mandatory, no laptop speakers), decent light on the face.

Install: OBS Studio 30 or newer. Guests install nothing.

## 1. YouTube event

The channel owner opens YouTube Studio, Create, Go Live. For rehearsal set Visibility to Unlisted.

Flow:

```text
YouTube Studio gives Stream URL plus Stream Key
  into OBS Settings > Stream (Service: YouTube)
    into YouTube over RTMP
```

Treat the stream key like a password. Do not paste it into chat, issues, or shared docs.

## 2. VDO.Ninja room

Create a room with a random suffix and a password. Room name must be alphanumeric only
(no hyphens or underscores): VDO.Ninja rewrites other characters to underscores and
shows a warning popup to whoever opens the link. Example: `bumbleLive7f42`.

Run:

```bash
./tools/generate-links.sh bumbleLive7f42 "YOUR-ROOM-PASSWORD"
```

It prints:

* 1 director link (you only)
* 3 guest links with fixed push IDs: `NicoCam`, `SebiCam`, `ChrisCam`
* 3 OBS view links with solo mode for clean isolated feeds

Why fixed push IDs: the OBS view link watches a stream ID. If the guest publishes with the same ID every time (`&push=NicoCam`), your OBS source keeps working after refresh. This is the documented permanent link pattern.

Send each guest link privately. Keep the director link and the password to yourself.

Guest join steps: open link, allow camera and microphone, pick the right devices, put headphones on, join.

**Do not use the director page's own "INVITE A GUEST" quick-copy link.** It looks like
a valid invite but assigns a random push id on every join (e.g. `push=6PZSAYr`), not
the fixed `NicoCam`/`SebiCam`/`ChrisCam`. The guest's camera works fine either way, but
OBS only watches the fixed id, so that source stays black with no error shown anywhere.
The only links that work are the three the generator printed for this room.

## 3. OBS setup

Profile `Bumbleflies YouTube`:

```text
Service: YouTube (RTMP, connect account or paste key)
Base canvas: 1920x1080, Output: 1920x1080, FPS: 30 common
Output: Advanced, Encoder: x264, Rate control: CBR
Bitrate: 8000 Kbps, Keyframe interval: 2 s, CPU preset: veryfast, Profile: high
Audio: 160 Kbps, 48 kHz, stereo
Recording: same encoder or x264 fallback, mkv or mp4
```

On a box with NVIDIA, you can switch the encoder to NVENC (preset P5, 9000 Kbps). That still works for 1080p30.

Scene collection `Bumbleflies Live` ships 8 scenes:

1. `01 Starting`: full screen branded overlay plus room tone
2. `02 Three`: Nico, Sebi, Chris side by side
3. `03 Nico`: Nico full screen
4. `04 Sebi`: Sebi full screen
5. `05 Chris`: Chris full screen
6. `06 Screen plus People`: screen share large left, three small faces right
7. `07 Break`: branded pause card
8. `08 End`: branded outro card

Background blur is available (client-side, no OBS filter needed) but does not reliably
turn on via a `&backgroundblur` URL parameter, confirmed not working either bare or
with an explicit value. Each person has to enable it themselves after joining: click
the camera/video icon in VDO.Ninja's own toolbar at the bottom of the page and turn on
Background Blur manually. Once set, it applies in every scene they appear in, not just
their solo one, and it stays on for that room/push id.

Browser sources: `Nico`, `Sebi`, `Chris`, each 1920x1080, 30 fps, with `Shutdown source when not visible` on to save CPU. Overlays are local HTML files from `overlays/`, added as Browser Source with Local file checked.

Audio: in OBS, watch the meters while each person counts. Aim for consistent peaks around minus 12 dB, no red. Everyone on headphones, always. Laptop speakers cause the echo loop: mic into VDO.Ninja into OBS into YouTube into the other guest speaker into their mic.

## 4. Screen share

The presenter does not touch their camera tab, it stays open and live exactly as is.
Instead they open a **second, separate browser tab** with the generator's dedicated
screen-share link (`push=ScreenShare`). In that new tab, when VDO.Ninja asks for a
video source, they choose Screen, Window, or Tab, not webcam.

OBS already has a `Screen` source watching `view=ScreenShare` for this room (the
generator wires it automatically, same as the three camera sources), so it populates
on its own once that tab is sharing. No OBS changes needed.

Switch to scene `06 Screen plus People` while presenting. When done, switch to another
scene and the presenter can close the screen-share tab; their camera keeps running
unaffected in the other tab.

Same rule as the camera links: it must be that exact `push=ScreenShare` link, not any
other sharing option VDO.Ninja's UI offers.

## 5. Rehearsal (do not skip)

T minus 60: everyone joins VDO.Ninja. Check camera, mic, headphones, light, background, network.

T minus 45: open OBS. Confirm Nico, Sebi, Chris video plus audio plus screen plus overlays.

T minus 30: start the encoder to YouTube, stay Unlisted. Check the YouTube preview in a browser, not just OBS.

T minus 20: run the full switch path: Starting, Three, Nico, Sebi, Chris, Screen plus People, Break, Three, End.

T minus 10: stop everything. Ask: could we rebuild this tomorrow without remembering? If not, simplify.

## 6. Emergency plan

Guest video freezes or drops: cut to Speaker on a remaining person, keep talking. Reinvite after the segment.

Guest audio fails: mute that source in OBS immediately, continue with two people.

Guest audio echoes: confirm headphones. If it persists, mute and ask them to rejoin with headphones.

VDO.Ninja dies: host continues solo full screen and narrates. Restart the room after.

OBS dies: restart OBS, reconnect to YouTube. YouTube Live Control Room shows stream health. Keep that tab open during the show.

YouTube connection drops: OBS auto reconnects. Do not create a second event mid show unless YouTube tells you the event ended.

## 7. After the show

End the stream in YouTube Studio first, then Stop Streaming in OBS. Save the local recording. Copy the stream key out of any pasted location. Note one fix for next time at the top of CHECKLIST.md.
